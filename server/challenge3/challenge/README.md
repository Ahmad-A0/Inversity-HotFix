**The Canine Catastrophe**

Meowazon Web Services, the leading provider of high reliability cat-name solutions, has been brought to its knees by a mischievous group of dogs. The canine culprits, ran into the hard drive causing disk corruption and server failure.

**Your Mission**

You've been tasked with restoring the Meowazon server to its former purrfect state. You need to:

1. Restore a backup of the server from the `backup` directory.
2. Replace the corrupted `app.js` file in `server` with a version from the `backup` directory, exactly as it was before the corruption (same contents and location).
3. Start the server back up using the `npm start` command.

The fate of the feline empire rests in your paws.

**Good luck!**
